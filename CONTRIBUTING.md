### Thanks for your interest in Open Legend!

Please note that Github is a place for specific, actionable feedback that focus on solutions to problems.

In order to reduce the chance of your issue being closed, follow these guidelines:

* Don't ask rules questions, the [Open Legend community site](http://community.openlegendrpg.com/) serves that purpose
* Don't critique an existing rule without a proposed solution, discuss first on the [Open Legend community site](http://community.openlegendrpg.com/)
* Try to stay on topic and take side conversations to a separate channel
